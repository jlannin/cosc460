Report for Lab 1
----------------

After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Justin Lannin

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I really enjoyed this assignment.  It was a very interesting way
to learn more about database structure as well as to gain experience
working with large Java projects. I also thought that it was a fun level of
challenging.


3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

I thought that the hardest part of this assignment was orienting myself
to all of the different java files and trying to figure out how they fit
together. Once I understood what all of the different pieces were (and
what functionalities/methods/variables they had), the assignment became
a lot more manageable.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

I think that my code should hopefully be pretty complete.  It
passes all of the unit tests as well as the given test (and others that
I ran) in Exercise 7. 

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

I spent both lab sessions as well as a couple of hours before the 
Milestone and a couple of hours before the final project was due 
working on this lab.
